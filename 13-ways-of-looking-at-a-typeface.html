                            <p>
                                For the first ten years of my career,
                                I worked for Massimo Vignelli,
                                a designer who is legendary for using
                                a very limited number of typefaces.
                                Between 1980 and 1990, most of my
                                projects were set in five fonts:
                                Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond
                                No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of
                                course, Bodoni. For Massimo, this was
                                an ideological choice, an ethical
                                imperative. “In the new computer age,”
                                he once wrote, “the proliferation of typefaces
                                and type manipulations represents
                                a new level of visual pollution threatening
                                our culture.Out of thousands of
                                typefaces, all we need are a few basic
                                ones, and trash the rest.”
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                For me, it became a time-saving device.
                                <br>
                                Why spend hours choosing between
                                Bembo, Sabon and Garamond No. 3
                                every time you needed a
                                Venetian Roman?
                                <br>
                                For most people — my mom, for
                                instance — these were
                                distinctions without differences.
                                <br>
                                Why not just commit to
                                Garamond No. 3 and never think about
                                it again?
                                <br>
                                My Catholic school education must
                                have well prepared me for this kind of
                                moral clarity.
                                <br>
                                I accepted it gratefully.
                            </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Then, after a decade, I left my first job.
                                Suddenly I could use any typeface
                                I wanted, and I went nuts. On one of my
                                first projects, I used 37 different fonts
                                on 16 pages. My wife, who had attended
                                Catholic school herself, found this all
                                too familiar. She remembered classmates
                                who had switched to public school
                                after eight years under the nuns: freed
                                at last from demure plaid uniforms,
                                they wore the shortest skirts they could
                                find. “Jesus,” she said, looking at one
                                of my multiple font demolition derbies.
                                “You’ve become a real slut,
                                haven’t you?”
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                It was true.
                                <br>
                                Liberated from monogamy,
                                I became typographically
                                promiscuous. I have since, I think,
                                learned to modulate my behavior — like
                                any substance abuser, I learned that
                                binges are <span class="noBreak">time-consuming</span>, costly,and
                                ultimately counterprodutive — but I’ve
                                never gone back to five-typeface sobriety.
                                Those thousands of typefaces are still
                                out there, but my recovery has required
                                that I become more discriminating and
                                come up with some answers to this
                                seemingly simple question: why choose
                                a particular typeface?
                                <br><br>

                        I’ve heard of several projects where the
                        designer found a font that was created
                        the same year the client’s organization
                        was founded. This must give the <span class="hyphenate">recommendation</span>
                        an aura of manifest destiny
                        that is positively irresistible. I haven’t
                        had that luck yet, but still try to find the
                        same kind of evocative alignment.

                        Some typefaces are just perfect for
                        certain things. I’ve specified exotic fonts
                        for identity programs that work beautifully
                        in headlines and even in text, but
                        sooner or later you have to set that really
                        tiny type at the bottom of the business
                        reply card. This is what Franklin Gothic
                        is for. Careful, though: some typefaces
                        work too well.

                        For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo
                        Novarese’s Eurostyle, but I came to love
                        it while working on a monograph on
                        Eero Saarinen: they both share an
                        expressiveness peculiar to the postwar
                        optimism of the 1950’s.

                        Once I saw a project in a student
                        portfolio that undertook the dubious
                        challenge of redesigning the Tiffany’s
                        identity. I particularly disliked the font
                        that was used, and I politely asked what
                        it was.

                    <p>
                        “Oh,” came the enthusiastic response,
                        “that’s the best part! It’s called Tiffany!”
                        On the other hand, Bruce Mau
                        designed Spectacle, the book he created
                        with David Rockwell, using the typeface
                        Rockwell. I thought this was funny.

                        Once I was working on a project where
                        the client group included some very
                        strong-minded architects. I picked
                        Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface
                        that was not only well-suited to the project’s
                        requirements, but was one of the
                        few I know that was designed by an
                        architect, Bertram Goodhue.

                    <p>
                        Recently, I designed a publications program
                        for a girls’ school. I used
                        a typeface that was designed by a
                        woman and named after another, Zuzana
                        Licko’s Mrs. Eaves. In both cases, my
                        clients knew that the public would be
                        completely unaware of the story behind
                        the font selection, but took some comfort
                        in it nonetheless. I did too.

                        on the premises when you show up,
                        and it just seems mean to evict it. “We
                        use Baskerville and Univers 65 on
                        all our materials, but feel free to make
                        an alternate suggestion.”
                        Really? Why bother?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s like one of those shows where the
                        amateur chef is given a turnip, a bag
                        of flour, a leg of lamb and some maple
                        syrup and told to make a dish out of it.
                        Sometimes it’s something you’ve never
                        used before, which makes it even
                        more fun.

                        never used before, for good reason. “We
                        use ITC Eras on all our materials.” “Can

                        Whenever I want to make words look
                        straightforward, conversational, and
                        smart, I frequently consider Futura,
                        upper and lower case. Why? Not because
                        Paul Renner was straightforward,
                        conversational, and smart, although he
                        might have been.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No, it’s because 45 years ago, Helmut
                        Krone decided to use Futura in
                        Doyle Dane Bernbach’s advertising for
                        Volkswagen, and they still use it today.
                        One warning, however: what reminds
                        you of something may remind someone
                        else of something else.

                        About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign
                        the logo for New York magazine.
                        Milton Glaser had based the logo on
                        Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface
                        I found unimaginably dated and ugly.
                        But Glaser’s logo had replaced an earlier
                        one by Peter Palazzo that was based on
                        Caslon Italic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I proposed we return to Caslon, and
                        distinctly remember saying, “Bookman
                        Swash Italic is always going to look
                        ugly.” The other day, I saw something in
                        the office that really caught my eye.
                        It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and
                        it looked great. Ugly, but great.

                        Tibor Kalman was fascinated with
                        boring typefaces. “No, this one is too
                        clever, this one is too interesting,” he
                        kept saying when showed him the fonts
                        I was proposing for his monograph.
                        Anything but a boring typeface, he felt,
                        got in the way of the ideas. We settled
                        on Trade Gothic.

                        In design as in fashion, nothing beats
                        bespoke tailoring. I’ve commissioned
                        custom typefaces from Jonathan Hoefler
                        and Tobias Frere-Jones and Joe Finocchiaro,
                        and we’re currently working
                        with Matthew Carter and Chester.
                        It is the ultimate indulgence, but well
                        worth the extra effort. Is this proliferation?
                        I say bring it on.

                        Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli
                        may be using too many typefaces, not
                        too few. A true fundamentalist requires a
                        monotheistic worldview: one world, one
                        typeface.

                        The designers at Experimental Jetset
                        have made the case for Helvetica. My
                        partner Abbott Miller had a period of life
                        he calls “The Scala Years” when he used
                        that typeface almost exclusively. When
                        the time is right, I might make that kind
                        of commitment myself.

                        Princeton Architectural Press is about to
                        publish a collection of essays I’ve written,
                        many of which first appeared here
                        on Design Observer. I wanted it to feel
                        like a real book for readers — it has no
                        pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it.
                        He suggested we set each one of the 79
                        pieces in a different typeface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I loved this idea, but wasn't sure how
                        far he’d want to go with it. “What about
                        the one called ‘I Hate ITC Garamond?’”
                        I asked him. “Would we set it in ITC
                        Garamond?” He looked at me as if I was
                        crazy. “Of course,” he said.
