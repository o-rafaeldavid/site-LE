                                The design of type has undergone numerous
                                 changes over time [4]. In the early years,
                                  typography was seen as a system made up 
                                  of a series of rules. The artistic movements
                                   that arrived at the beginning of the twentieth
                                    century rejected the historical forms and 
                                    transformed outdated aspects of visual language
                                    and expression. However, projects that combined 
                                    software, arts and design only appeared a few 
                                    years later with the proliferation of personal computers,
                                    allowing programming to reach a wider audience.

                                Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design
                                    type changed, and new possibilities for typographic 
                                    experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) 
                                    grammar-based techniques that explore the principle 
                                    of database amplification (e.g. [2]); (ii) 
                                    evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under
                                     the direction of a designer (e.g. [22, 15]); 
                                     (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems 
                                     that learn the glyphs features to build new ones
                                      (e.g. [14]) [18]. These computational approaches
                            can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration.

                                Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by 
                                type designers who study the shape of each letter
                                 and its design with great precision, despite the
                                  emergence of these new possibilities. Type design
                                   is a hugely complex discipline, and its expertise
                                ensures typography quality [28]. Moreover, with the
                                 proliferation of web typography and online reading, 
                                 the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased,
                                  allowing more options for font designers and font users.
                                   Additionally, visual identities created nowadays are 
                                   becoming more dynamic [17]. Museums, institutions, 
                                   organisations, events and media increasingly rely 
                                   on this type of identity.

                 <p>
                    Over time, the methods and technologies
                    available for type design have improved
                    and designers have to evolve and adapt
                    their process of thinking in accordance.
                    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
                    revealed impressive advances, presenting
                    high-resolution images nearly indistinguishable
                    from the real ones. In the typographic field,
                    they are helpful when one wishes to obtain
                    coherent glyphs in a typeface. When designing
                    a typeface, one has to simultaneously seek an
                    aesthetically appealing result and coherence
                    among the different glyphs. This can be
                    facilitated by exploring the similarities
                    between the same letter present across 
                    diverse fonts,and the transferred stylistic
                    elements within the same font [5]. Balashova
                    et al. [2] develop a stroke-based geometric
                    model for glyphs, a fitting procedure to
                    re-parametrize arbitrary fonts to capture
                    these correlations.
                 </p>
                <br><br>
             
                 <p>
                    The framework uses a manifold learning technique
                    that allows for interactively improving the fit quality
                    and interpolating, adding or removing stylistic
                    elements in existing fonts. Campbell and Kautz
                    [3] develop a similar contour-based framework
                    allowing the editing of a glyph and the propagation
                    of stylistic elements across the entire alphabet. Phan et al.
                    [19] and Suveeranont and Igarashi [26] present two different
                    frameworks that give one or more outline-based glyphs of
                    several characters as input, producing a complete typeface
                    that bears a similar style to the inputs. Rehling and Hofstadter
                    [21] use one or more grid-based lowercase letters to generate
                    the rest of the Roman alphabet, creating glyphs that share
                    different style features. Azadi et al. [1] develop an end-to-end
                    stacked conditional GAN model to generate a set of highly-stylized
                    glyph images following a consistent style from very few examples.

                        We can also imitate the behavior of a variable<br>
                        font using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and<br>
                        interpolate to obtain intermediate results. Lopes<br>
                        et al. [14] model the drawing process of fonts by<br>
                        building sequential generative models of vector<br>
                        graphics. Their model provides a scale-invariant<br>
                        representation of imagery. The latent representation<br>
                        may be systematically exploited to achieve style<br>
                        propagation. Shamir and Rappoport [24] present a<br>
                        parametric feature-based font design approach. The<br>
                        development of a visual design system and the use<br>
                        of constraints for preserving the designer’s intentions<br>
                        create a more natural environment in which<br>
                        high-level parametric behaviors can be defined. By<br>
                        changing the glyph parameters they create several<br>
                        family instances. Also, outside the typographic field,<br>
                        there are some good examples exploring the latent<br>
                        space. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sketch-RNN [7] is an RNN able to construct strokebased<br>
                        drawings. The network produces sketches of common<br>
                        objects in a vector format and explores the latent space<br>
                        interpolation of various vector images. There is also<br>
                        increased attention to these networks and their<br>
                        application to facilitate the use and combination of fonts.<br>
                        A usual way to combine different fonts is by using fonts<br>
                        from the same family or created by the same designer.<br>
                        Another way is to find fonts that match x-height and<br>
                        ascenders/descenders. Fontjoy [20] is another tool to<br>
                        facilitate the process of mixing and matching typefaces<br>
                        and choosing fonts to use side by side.<br>
                        FontMap [8] and Font-VAE [10] are tools developed with<br>
                        the goal of discovering alternative fonts<br>
                         with the same aesthetics.
