                                The design of type has undergone numerous
                                 changes over time [4]. In the early years,
                                  typography was seen as a system made up 
                                  of a series of rules. The artistic movements
                                   that arrived at the beginning of the twentieth
                                    century rejected the historical forms and 
                                    transformed outdated aspects of visual language
                                    and expression. However, projects that combined 
                                    software, arts and design only appeared a few 
                                    years later with the proliferation of personal computers,
                                    allowing programming to reach a wider audience.
                                    Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design
                                    type changed, and new possibilities for typographic 
                                    experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) 
                                    grammar-based techniques that explore the principle 
                                    of database amplification (e.g. [2]); (ii) 
                                    evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under
                                     the direction of a designer (e.g. [22, 15]); 
                                     (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems 
                                     that learn the glyphs features to build new ones
                                      (e.g. [14]) [18]. These computational approaches
                                       can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration.

                                For me, it became a time-saving device.

                                Why spend hours choosing between
                                Bembo, Sabon and Garamond No. 3
                                every time you needed a
                                Venetian Roman?
                                <br>
                                For most people — my mom, for
                                instance — these were
                                distinctions without differences.
                                <br>
                                Why not just commit to
                                Garamond No. 3 and never think about
                                it again?
                                <br>
                                My Catholic school education must
                                have well prepared me for this kind of
                                moral clarity.
                                <br>
                                I accepted it gratefully.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Then, after a decade, I left my first job.
                                Suddenly I could use any typeface
                                I wanted, and I went nuts. On one of my
                                first projects, I used 37 different fonts
                                on 16 pages. My wife, who had attended
                                Catholic school herself, found this all
                                too familiar. She remembered classmates
                                who had switched to public school
                                after eight years under the nuns: freed
                                at last from demure plaid uniforms,
                                they wore the shortest skirts they could
                                find. “Jesus,” she said, looking at one
                                of my multiple font demolition derbies.
                                “You’ve become a real slut,
                                haven’t you?”
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                It was true.
                                <br>
                                Liberated from monogamy,
                                I became typographically
                                promiscuous. I have since, I think,
                                learned to modulate my behavior — like
                                any substance abuser, I learned that
                                binges are <span class="noBreak">time-consuming</span>, costly,and
                                ultimately counterprodutive — but I’ve
                                never gone back to five-typeface sobriety.
                                Those thousands of typefaces are still
                                out there, but my recovery has required
                                that I become more discriminating and
                                come up with some answers to this
                                seemingly simple question: why choose
                                a particular typeface?
                                <br><br>
