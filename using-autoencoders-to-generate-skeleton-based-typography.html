                                The design of type has undergone numerous
                                 changes over time [4]. In the early years,
                                  typography was seen as a system made up 
                                  of a series of rules. The artistic movements
                                   that arrived at the beginning of the twentieth
                                    century rejected the historical forms and 
                                    transformed outdated aspects of visual language
                                    and expression. However, projects that combined 
                                    software, arts and design only appeared a few 
                                    years later with the proliferation of personal computers,
                                    allowing programming to reach a wider audience.

                                Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design
                                    type changed, and new possibilities for typographic 
                                    experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) 
                                    grammar-based techniques that explore the principle 
                                    of database amplification (e.g. [2]); (ii) 
                                    evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under
                                     the direction of a designer (e.g. [22, 15]); 
                                     (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems 
                                     that learn the glyphs features to build new ones
                                      (e.g. [14]) [18]. These computational approaches
                            can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration.

                                Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by 
                                type designers who study the shape of each letter
                                 and its design with great precision, despite the
                                  emergence of these new possibilities. Type design
                                   is a hugely complex discipline, and its expertise
                                ensures typography quality [28]. Moreover, with the
                                 proliferation of web typography and online reading, 
                                 the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased,
                                  allowing more options for font designers and font users.
                                   Additionally, visual identities created nowadays are 
                                   becoming more dynamic [17]. Museums, institutions, 
                                   organisations, events and media increasingly rely 
                                   on this type of identity.

                    Over time, the methods and technologies<br>
                     available for type design have improved<br>
                      and designers have
                      to evolve and adapt<br>their process of thinking in 
                      accordance. Generative<br> Adversarial Networks (GANs)
                       have revealed<br> impressive advances, presenting high-resolution<br>
                        images nearly indistinguishable from the real ones. 
                        <br>In the typographic field, they are helpful when one
                         wishes to obtain coherent glyphs in a typeface. 
                         When designing a typeface, one has to simultaneously
                          seek an aesthetically appealing result and coherence
                           among the different glyphs. This can be facilitated
                            by exploring the similarities between the same letter
                             present across diverse fonts, and the transferred stylistic
                              elements within the same font [5]. Balashova et al. [2]
                               develop a stroke-based geometric model for glyphs, a fitting
                                procedure to re-parametrise arbitrary fonts to capture these correlations. 
                 </p>
                <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    The framework uses a manifold learning technique that allows for interactively improving the fit quality and interpolating, adding or removing stylistic elements in existing fonts. Campbell and Kautz [3] develop a similar contour-based framework allowing the editing of a glyph and the propagation of stylistic elements across the entire alphabet. Phan et al. [19] and Suveeranont and Igarashi [26] present two different frameworks that give one or more outline-based glyphs of several characters as input, producing a complete typeface that bears a similar style to the inputs. Rehling and Hofstadter [21] use one or more grid-based lowercase letters to generate the rest of the Roman alphabet, creating glyphs that share different style features. Azadi et al. [1] develop an end-to-end stacked conditional GAN model to generate a set of highly-stylised glyph images following a consistent style from very few examples.
